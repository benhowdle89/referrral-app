Referrral
=============

Backbone.js front-end for Referrral

Technically a Node.js Express application, which only serves to forward all incoming requests to `index.html`, at which point the Backbone.js application fires up and starts handling PushState events.

Uses Browserify for dependency management, and npm for package management. 

Sass for CSS pre-processing.

Gulp for dev pre-processing and build processes.
